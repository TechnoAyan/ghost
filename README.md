An online editor in the making in node.js 

Currently:

Displays a normal text editor. Made in accordance with Ace Editor. Using [monogjs](http://mafintosh.github.io/mongojs/) for monogodb.

To run locally:
```
npm install
```
This installs all the necessary dependencies. Make sure you install ALL the dependencies before proceeding.

As a database, mongodb has been used. So, you'll need to start mongodb in a terminal.
Open a new terminal and start your mongodb server
```
mongod
```
Now you are ready to run:

```
